## gke databases
In this directory you can find GKE analysis results for turbulent channels at two different values of friction Reynolds number Retau=200 and Retau=1000. Information on the underlying database of turbulent channel velocity fields produced via Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) can be found in 

``` D. Gatti et al., "An efficient numerical method for the Generalized Kolmogorov Equation", Journal of Turbulence, (submitted, 2018) ```   

The database is made up of several VTK files, which can be opened and visualzed with the open-source data analysis and visualization software [paraview](https://www.paraview.org).
